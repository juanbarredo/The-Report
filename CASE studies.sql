--at this point I am trying to solve The Report problem in Hacker Rank.

--I believe that using a CASE will help me make it so that certain parts of the answer are printed as null.

--I need to get down and do a few CASE examples from the book

--CASE Expressions

--In dabatabase programing, 
--it is sometimes necessary to modify the representation of data.

--For instance, a person't status can be coded using the values 1, 2, 3 
--(from female, male, and child, respectively).

--Suchj a programming technique can reduce the time for the implementation of a program.

--the CASE expression in Transact-SQL language makes this type of encoding easy to implement.

--NOTE 
--CASE does not represent a statement (as in most programming languages) but an expression.
--Therefore, the CASE expression can be used (almost) everywhere the Transact-SQL language allows the use of an expression.

--The CASE expression has two different forms:

--simple CASE expression
--Searched CASE expression

--The syntax of the simple CASE expression is

--CASE expression_1
--		{WHEN expression_2 THEN result_1} ...
--		[ELSE result_n]
--END

--I need to get down and understand what an expression is
--I thought I already looked into it?
